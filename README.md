# Restaurant_Menu_Ordering_System_IoT

This project was developed during my specialized course in my bachelor's program. It demonstrates a user-friendly interface and reduces the need for human intervention during the ordering of dishes.

The restaurant menu ordering system consists of two ends:

1. User Interface.
2. Admin Interface.

## Broadly speaking about the interfaces:

### User Interface:

This interface is located at the consumer end and collects data from customers regarding their dish orders.

### Admin Interface:

This interface is located at the management end, where the management can track the dishes ordered from various tables and also display the total amount made by the consumers.
